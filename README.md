# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Project
This project is based on the MNIST( Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology ) Dataset consisting of 70,000 gray scale images of digits ranging from 0 to 9. Each picture of 28*28 pixels and partitioned into 60,000 training and 10,000 test images. The project is regarding using this data and training a deep learning model for digit prediction based on the user input of a drawn digit through a Graphical User Interface.
